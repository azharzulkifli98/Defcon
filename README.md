**Repo Rules**

Do not change the .gitignore

Provide detailed descriptions of your commits

Ensure there are no notices or errors in the Unity Editor after saving your file, before commiting changes.

`throw new System.NotImplementedException();'

Include a statement as above in functions with declarations but no implementations.

Pull frequently from the master
